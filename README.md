```
âš  The point of filtering by availability is not understood, because when the user schedules an appointment,
he selects a day and a time, so to indicate when the doctor is available or not would require reviewing the
list of appointments (in this case the global status of Redux) and compare it with the schedule when the user
is viewing the exercise, so it would be a much more extensive development thought in this exercise.
```
